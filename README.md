This chicken just hatched. When it eventually grows up (after some delay) it promises to deal with futures.

Aye tries to be fully compatible with [kriskowal's Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) in such a way that you can always replace ```aye``` with ```Q```. It will however not try to implement anything close to the full feature set. Check ```test/CompatibilitySpecRunner.html``` to see Aye's test suite executed against Q.

Install
-------

    $ bower install aye

Run the test suite
------------------

First install dependencies via ```bower install```. Point your browser to ```test/SpecRunner.html``` and ```test/CompatibilitySpecRunner.html```.
